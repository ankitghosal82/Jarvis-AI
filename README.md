# 🤖 JARVIS - Your AI Voice Assistant

**JARVIS** is a personal, voice-activated AI assistant built entirely with Python. Inspired by Marvel's fictional JARVIS, this assistant listens, speaks, searches, reads, plays music, detects languages, and even remembers what you told it — all using natural language.

- 💬 **Conversational AI** – Intelligent replies via Cohere's large language model.
- 📄 **PDF Reader** – Reads PDF content out loud.
- 📚 **Wikipedia Integration** – Provides quick summaries from Wikipedia.
- 🎶 **Music Playback** – Plays songs on YouTube through voice.
- 📝 **Smart Note-Taking** – Save notes or reminders with a command.
- 🌍 **Language Detection** – Understands which language you're speaking.
- 🧠 **Short-Term Memory** – Recalls the last 10 interactions.
- 🔊 **Voice Output** – Speaks back responses using text-to-speech.
- 🖥️ **Terminal or GUI Ready** – Runs smoothly in the terminal or can be paired with a UI.
